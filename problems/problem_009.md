### Problem - Find the non-duplicate number
This problem was recently asked by Facebook:

Given a list of numbers, where every number shows up twice except for one number, find that one number.
##### Example:
```
* Input: [4, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2]
* Output: 1
```
Here is the function signature as a starting point (in Python):
```python
def single_number(nums):
    #Fill this in.
    pass

print(single_number([4, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2]))
# 1
```
