##### Problem: Sorting a list with 3 unique numbers

This problem was recently asked by Google:

Given a list of numbers with only 3 unique numbers (1, 2, 3), sort the list in ```O(n)``` time.

##### Example:
```
* Input: [3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1]
* Output: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
```
Here is the function signature as a starting point (in Python):
```python
def sort_nums(nums):
    #Fill this in.
    pass

print(sort_nums([3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1]))
# [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
```
