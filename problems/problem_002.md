##### Problem Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Here is an example solution in Python language. (Any language is OK to use in an interview, though we'd recommend Python as a generalist language utilized by companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix, Dropbox, Pinterest, Uber, etc.,)
####Example:
```
Input: 'abrkaabcdefghijjxxx'
Output: 10
Explanation: 'abcdefghij'
```
Here is the function signature as a starting point (in Python):
```python
class Solution:
  def length_of_longest_substring(self, s):
    # Fill this in.
    pass

print(Solution().length_of_longest_substring('abrkaabcdefghijjxxx'))
# 10
```
